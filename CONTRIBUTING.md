# Contributing to ptsa_plot

## How to contribute new code

1. Fork this repository and create a new branch
2. Add your new code to a sensible place
3. Follow [PEP8][] guidelines as best as possible (it's OK to ignore the line
   length limit of 80 characters)
4. Add unit tests to ensure that everything works as expected
5. Submit a pull request
6. Make modifications as requested by the maintainers

Your new code should run on Python 3 and legacy Python 2.7. Some exceptions may
exist if dependencies for some reason are not compatible with certain Python
versions (you should seriously consider if it's a necessary dependency if that
is the case).
